# mtm6201-final
for my final assignment portfolio

## My Portfolio Site
I created this to display my work as a designer and photographer. I hope to continue the development of this site with: 
- A blog page
- A contact page
- Portfolio category pages

## The process
This design was created based of a figma prototype, using bootstrap. I began my process by using Bootstrap's CDN install, but later in the development decided to install the files locally. This was my first experience with SCSS or using NPM installation. The many challenges I worked through during this process has taught me a lot for future projects. 

## External Resources
As mentioned, Bootstrap 5.3 was used throughout this site. 

In addition to this, I have installed **Slick** for an image carousel on the homepage. This was a new tool for me and has been quite tricky to get working as intended, but I am confident with the use of it now and will certainly use Slick in future projects. 

Another library I have used was **AOS - Animate on Scroll Library**. This one I chose to use through CDN, as I did not intend to make any changes to the animations. I used this throughout each page of my Portfolio. 

Another tool I found useful was [johnfraney.ca/tools/responsive-image-generator/](https://johnfraney.ca/tools/responsive-image-generator/). I used this for responsive images throughout my site. 

For a bento grid on my homepage, I used the site [ui.bootstrap.ninja/components/marketing/bento-grids/](https://ui.bootstrap.ninja/components/marketing/bento-grids/). This was a useful jump-off point for me to edit the contents to suite my own needs.
